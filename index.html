<p1>this is one of the first assignments we have ever done. what we had to do was simple. first figure out what flavors of ice cream i enjoy then find out the color code and color the poem with these colors.
  then we had to draw a image of our 18 flavors of ice cream falling down "as said in the poem"</p1>
